Sales vs Profitability Analysis (Power BI)

## Objective
To analyze why revenue growth is not translating into proportional profit growth and identify regions and segments causing margin pressure.

## Dataset
Simulated sales dataset containing:
- Sales transactions
- Product categories
- Customer segments
- Date hierarchy

## Approach
- Built a star-schema data model in Power BI
- Created DAX measures for Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin %, YTD, and YoY
- Designed an executive dashboard to compare revenue growth vs profitability
- Performed regional and segment-level margin analysis

## Key Insights
- Sales growth outpaces profit growth over time
- South region drives the highest revenue but has the lowest profit margin
- Mid-Market segment in the South shows structurally lower margins

## Business Recommendation
Review pricing strategy and cost structure for South Mid-Market accounts to prevent revenue growth from diluting overall profitability.
